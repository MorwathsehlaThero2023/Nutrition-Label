# Nutrition-Label

The Nutrition Label project demonstrated my skills in combining HTML and CSS to design a responsive and visually appealing nutrition label. HTML was used to structure the label's content, while CSS styling was applied to replicate the appearance of an actual nutrition label found on food products. The project emphasized attention to detail and responsive design principles to ensure the label's readability across different screen sizes.
